# Gold Badge Challenges

This is a Repository to showcase what I learned in the Gold Badge section of the Software Development course through multiple challenges.

I completed three of the available challenges in three days.

## Challenge 1 - Komodo Cafe

- In this challenge the developer is tasked with:
    
    1. Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
    2. Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
    3. Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test your constructors or objects, just your methods)
    4. Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.

- This challenge mainly consisted of three key files

    1. [MenuItem.cs](./01_KomodoCafe.Repository/MenuItem.cs) This contains the POCOS.
    2. [MenuItemRepository.cs](./01_KomodoCafe.Repository/MenuItemRepository.cs) This contains the CRUD methods.
    3. [ProgramUI.cs](./01_KomodoCafe.UI/ProgramUI.cs) This contains the console code.

## Challenge 3 - Komodo Badges


- This challenge mainly consisted of three key files

    1. [Badge.cs](./03_KomodoBadge_Repository/Badge.cs) This contains the POCOS.
    2. [BadgeRepository.cs](./03_KomodoBadge_Repository/BadgeRepository.cs) This contains the CRUD methods.
    3. [ProgramUI.cs](./03_KomodoBadges.UI/ProgramUI.cs) This is the console code.

- The main challenge in this project was working with Dictionaries as the Badge ID and Door Numbers are a key/value pair.

## Challenge 4 - Komodo Outings

- This challenge mainly consisted of three key files

    1. [Outing.cs](./04_KomodoOutings.Repository/Outing.cs) This contains the POCOS.
    2. [BadgeRepository.cs](./04_KomodoOutings.Repository/Outing.cs) This contains the CRUD methods.
    3. [ProgramUI.cs](./04_KomodoOutings.UI/ProgramUI.cs) This is the console code.
